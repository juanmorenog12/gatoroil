## Appointment form behavior

- Phones/tablets: opens the customer's SMS app with the request pre-filled to (352) 933-5038.
- Desktop/laptop: submits the request directly to GatorOilServices@gmail.com using FormSubmit's AJAX endpoint and shows a confirmation without leaving the page.
- IMPORTANT: FormSubmit requires a one-time email activation. After the first desktop test submission, open GatorOilServices@gmail.com and click the FormSubmit activation/confirmation link. Until that is confirmed, live submissions will not be delivered normally.


## FormSubmit one-time setup (v11)

This version is prepared for FormSubmit's **Invisible Email** identifier.

1. Upload `index.html`, `main.js`, and `business-config.js` to GitHub.
2. Open the live site at `https://juanmorenog12.github.io/gatoroil/` and submit one test request.
3. Open the FormSubmit activation email sent to `GatorOilServices@gmail.com` and confirm it.
4. In the confirmation/activation email, copy the random-like **Invisible Email** string FormSubmit provides.
5. Open `business-config.js` and replace:

```js
formSubmitId: "",
```

with:

```js
formSubmitId: "PASTE_THE_RANDOM_STRING_HERE",
```

6. Upload only `business-config.js` again.

Do not paste the full `https://formsubmit.co/...` URL into `formSubmitId`; paste only the random string.

When the website moves to a custom domain, also change `formUrl` to the final HTTPS URL.
